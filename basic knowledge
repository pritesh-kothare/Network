🔶 What is VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)?

A VLAN is a virtual network created inside a single physical switch.
It logically separates devices into different networks even if they are connected to the same switch.

Think of it like creating multiple separate rooms inside one big hall.

🔶 Why VLAN is Needed?

Without VLANs, all devices in a switch are in the same network, can talk to each other directly → not secure and causes broadcast traffic.

VLANs help to:

✔ Separate networks
✔ Improve security
✔ Reduce broadcast traffic
✔ Segment users (Wi-Fi, Servers, CCTV, Guest network etc.)
✅ 3. For Security & Isolation

VLANs create boundaries:
✔ CCTV cameras → VLAN 40
✔ Biometric machines → VLAN 50
✔ IoT devices → VLAN 60

These devices cannot talk to corporate network.

✅ 4. For Voice (IP Phones)

Switch ports carry:

Data VLAN (PC traffic)

Voice VLAN (Phone traffic)

Example:

switchport access vlan 10
switchport voice vlan 200

✅ 5. For Trunk Links Between Switches

When many VLANs need to be carried between switches → use trunk ports.

Example:

Switch to core switch

Switch to Access Points

Switch to Firewall

switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,21-25

🔶 Types of VLANs
VLAN Type	Use
Access VLAN	For end devices (PC, Printer, CCTV)
Voice VLAN	IP phones
Management VLAN	Switch/WLC management (like VLAN 21)
Native VLAN	Used on trunk ports
Trunk VLANs	Carry multiple VLANs between switches
🔶 Simple Example

📌 Without VLANs:
Everyone is in 192.168.1.0 → very insecure.

📌 With VLANs:

HR: 192.168.10.0

Finance: 192.168.20.0

WiFi Corporate: 10.21.28.0

Guest: 10.25.10.0

Each is isolated by the switch + ACLs + firewall.

🔶 Summary
✔ VLAN = Logical separation inside a switch
✔ Used to segment users, Wi-Fi, servers, cameras
✔ Essential for security, performance, and management
✔ Used everywhere: switches, routers, firewalls, WLCs

VLAN Trunking

 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20


🔶 What is VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)?

VTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to manage VLANs across multiple switches automatically.

It allows you to:

✔ Create VLANs on one switch
✔ Automatically send those VLANs to all other switches in the network
✔ Keep VLAN names and IDs consistent

📌 VTP is used only between switches connected using trunk ports.

🔶 Why VTP Is Used?

Without VTP → You must manually create VLANs on every switch.

With VTP → You create VLANs only once (on the server switch), and they automatically propagate.

✔ Saves time
✔ Prevents mistakes
✔ Ensures consistency

🔶 VTP Modes

There are three main modes:

Mode	Purpose
Server	Can create/modify/delete VLANs → distributes to all switches
Client	Cannot create VLANs → only receives VLAN info
Transparent	Does NOT participate in VTP but forwards VTP packets
🔶 VTP Domain

All switches must be in the same VTP domain name to participate.

Example:

vtp domain BOB-Network

🔶 VTP Version

VTP has 3 versions:

Version	Use
V1	Basic VLAN propagation
V2	Token Ring support (old)
V3	Supports extended VLANs (1006–4096), more secure

Best practice: Use VTP Version 3.

🔶 How VTP Works (Simple)

1️⃣ Switch in server mode creates a VLAN
2️⃣ VLAN information is carried over trunk ports
3️⃣ Other switches in client mode automatically learn VLANs
4️⃣ All switches stay synchronized

🔶 VTP Pruning

VTP pruning reduces unnecessary VLAN traffic on trunks.

Example:
✔ If VLAN 30 does not exist on Switch-2
✔ Trunk will stop sending VLAN 30 broadcast/multicast traffic to Switch-2

Command:

vtp pruning

🔶 VTP Configuration Example (Cisco Switch)
Set VTP Domain Name
vtp domain BOB-Network

Set VTP Mode
vtp mode server


(or client / transparent)

Set VTP Version
vtp version 3

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol used in Layer 2 (switching) to prevent loops in a network that has redundant links.

🕸️ Why do we need STP?

In a network with multiple switches, redundant links are used for backup.
But Layer 2 doesn’t have TTL (Time To Live) like IP, so a broadcast frame can loop endlessly, causing:

Broadcast storms

MAC address table instability

Network crash

👉 STP automatically detects loops and blocks extra paths, keeping only one active path.

🔧 How STP Works (Simple Explanation)
1️⃣ Elect Root Bridge

All switches choose one as the Root Bridge (center of the network).
Lowest Bridge ID (Priority + MAC) wins.

2️⃣ Calculate Best Path

Each switch calculates the best path to the Root Bridge using STP messages (BPDUs).

3️⃣ Block Redundant Links

To prevent loops, STP blocks ports that would create a loop.

📦 Port Roles in STP
Port Role	Function
Root Port (RP)	Best path to Root Bridge
Designated Port (DP)	Forwarding port for a network segment
Blocked / Non-Designated Port	Prevents loops

NTP 
Network Time Protocol
It is used to synchronize time between computers, servers, switches, routers, and network devices over a network.
How to configure NTP
configure terminal
clock timezone IST 5 30
ntp server 10.10.10.10
ntp server 10.10.10.11
end
 “NTP has been configured on all network devices using internal authenticated NTP servers to ensure accurate system time, reliable log correlation, and compliance with RBI security guidelines.”
